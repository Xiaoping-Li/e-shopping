# e-shopping
This is a Full-stack project about e-commerce shopping cart.
1. Database: MongoDB
2. Frontend: Expo React Native, Mobx, stripe-client, React Navigation, 
3. Backend: Express, Express-session, Nodemailer, Stripe

Readings:
1. ScrollView vs. FlatList
    * ScrollView for **a small amount of items**: because all the elements and views of a ScrollView are rendered, even if they are not currently shown on the screen.
    * FlatList fits to **large amount of items**.

## Installation Instructions
This is a Full-stack project, so before you could run the app through Expo on your device (iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or emulators on your PC):
* 1. Firstly, make sure you have Expo installed on your devices or your emulators
* 2. Secondly, set up your server side database and REST APIs successfully
* 3. Finally, wire up the Front-end with the successfully running Back-end

**Notes:** I developed and tested this project through Expo installed on my iPhone 6. I prefer to use nonspecific features, (features  neither IOS only nor Android only), but because I used iPhone, there were probably features that would work differently on IOS and Android. 

### SET UP Back-end: Database & REST APIs


### WIRE UP Front-end
